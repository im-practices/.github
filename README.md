# .github
Community Health Files for the `im-practices` organization.

Each repository within this organization will inherit these default files unless the repository has defined their own.

## Workflow Templates
The templates defined in this repository have been customized for our build processes and standards.  By including them in this repository, users can [add a workflow] to their repo by clicking a button.

The templates defined in this repository are also the source of truth for the `im-` templates in each of the Enterprise Org `.github` repos.  When a merge to main happens, the template files in this repo will be copied to the other `.github` repositories in the Enterprise.  If changes have been made to any of the `im-` template files in those organizations' `.github` repos they will be overwritten by these changes.

## Adding new Templates
If there are new templates that can be used across many organizations, please make a PR to this repository so they can be shared with each organization in the Enterprise.  

Templates that are specific to an organization should be added directly to that organization's `.github` repository.  Those template files should contain the `org-` prefix instead of the `im-` prefix.  Using the correct prefix will keep them from being overridden when this repository is synced with the others.

For detailed info around creating or modifying the templates see [Sharing workflows with your organization].

The templates in this repository fall into one of the following categories:
- Build
- Deploy
- Test
- Run
 
### Template Standards
- For new `.svg` files ensure:
  - [ ] The file contains the `im_` prefix
- For new `properties.json` files ensure:
  - [ ] The file contains the appropriate `im-<build|deploy|test|run>-` prefix
  - [ ] The `name` field has a category prefix (Build, Deploy, Test, Run)
    - This is included so templates are easier to identify when looking for workflows to add
  - [ ] The `iconName` field contains one of the [SVGs](#svgs) listed below
    - im_build
    - im_deploy
    - im_test
    - im_run
    - im_tf
    - im_checkmarx
- For new `.yml` files ensure:
  - [ ] The file contains the appropriate `im-<build|deploy|test|run>-` prefix
  - [ ] Clearly mark what needs to be customized or populated by the user
  - [ ] Avoid using default values that may be overlooked
  - [ ] Clearly state the format if something specific is required
