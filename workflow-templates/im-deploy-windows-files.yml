# Workflow Code: MysteriousStranger_v6    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    Gathers various stakeholder and attestor approvals, downloads artifacts from a release with the
#    specified tags, makes changes to any configuration files for the specified environments, stops
#    the service, deploys the pre-built artifacts to a target machine then starts the service. Each
#    deployable project in a solution should have their own deployment workflow.
#
# Frequency:
#    If files from this repository are being deployed at different intervals to one or more places, having a seperate deployment
#    workflow is preferable.  The same workflow can be used even if multple server targets are deployed to during the same deployment
#    cycle.
#
# TODO: Prerequisites:
#     - Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
#     - Set up a deployment board if it does not already exist: https://github.com/im-practices/git-er-done/blob/main/actions/deployment-board.md
#       Generally one board should be set up per windows service in the repository.
#     - The target server must be domain joined. If this is not the case already, create an ITHD ticket to have it joined to
#       the ExtendHealth domain for service account authentication
#     - Create an ITHD ticket to have an ExtendHealth Active directory service account created for each deployment environment.
#       That service account should then be added to an AD Group Policy Object (GPO); that GPO will then be applied to target
#       servers/deployment environments. If this deployment process and the service accounts are no longer needed at some point,
#       let infrastructure know that they can remove the accounts and GPOs
#     - Make sure the Service account secrets have been added to the environment
#     - Do not use the instructions in the windows server action to prep the target server for WinRM connections,
#       those instructions are more for an open-source user. Instead, WinRM listeners should already be configured on target servers.
#       If a WinRM connection can't be established create an ITHD ticket to have the WinRM listeners fixed or created
