# Workflow Code: BubblyGreyhound_v26    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    Checks out the repository and deploys a directory to the
#    specified storage account when someone kicks it off manually.
#
# Frequency:
#    - This workflow can be duplicated for as many storage
#      account deployments that the repository contains
#
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    - Storage Account Deployment (Core Template)
#
# TODO: Prerequisites:
#    - Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
#    - Set up a deployment board if it does not already exist: https://github.com/im-practices/git-er-done/blob/main/docs/actions/deployment-board.md
