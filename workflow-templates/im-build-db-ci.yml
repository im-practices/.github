# Workflow Code: GiddyBuzzard_v20    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    The main purpose of this workflow is to verify that the database can be created, all of the migration scripts can be run, and any tests that exist pass.
#    In addition to that, however, there are three other things this workflow template is set up to do.
#      1. Create snapshots. Snapshots are create sql object (table, view, sproc, etc.) scripts that show the shape of an object and can be
#         useful for keeping a historical record in GitHub of the changes to them.
#      2. Create a backup of the database and store it for later consumption. The backup can then be used in a workflow to circumvent the need
#         to spin up the database from scratch. Very helpful for decreasing build times. Please note however that this is only a backup of a local database.
#         It does not take the place of backups that should be happening of Production databases.
#      3. Create mock sql objects that can be consumed by other database repos' CI processes. A flag on the build database step in this workflow can be set
#         so that your database's dependencies are downloaded and installed.
#
#    The need for creating snapshots and backups in this workflow is not a very common need. They are here in case you need them, but likely you won't.
#    There are TODO's throughout this template that let you know when something isn't necessary if you don't want snapshots and/or backups created.
#
#    Creating mock sql objects is a bit less rare of a need, but only if your database is a sectioned off part of the legacy ExtendHealth monolith. Again,
#    there will be TODO's showing you where some items can be removed if you don't have any dependencies and/or don't need to create mock objects to be
#    consumed by others.
#

#    - This workflow should only be used once per repository
