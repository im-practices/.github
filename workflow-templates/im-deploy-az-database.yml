# Workflow Code: BetrayedCod_v36    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    Gathers the required approvals from stakeholders and attestors, ensures
#    tags are valid for production deployments and runs the migrations against
#    an Azure SQL database when someone kicks it off manually.
#
# Frequency:
#     Each deployable az db in the repository should have their own copy of this workflow rather than trying to deploy several
#     az databases with the same workflow.  If the db is deployed as part of a group, the db still needs its own copy of this
#     workflow but it will be streamlined (instructions below) since the Deploy Multiple Items workflow handles many of these checks.
#
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    - Azure SQL Database           (Core Template)
#
# TODO Prerequisites:
#    - Make sure the az secrets have been added to the environment
#    - Make sure the prod runners have access to the database with a 'azurerm_sql_virtual_network_rule'
#    - Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
#    - Create an entity in this repo's catalog-info.yml that represents what is being deployed if it does not already exist
