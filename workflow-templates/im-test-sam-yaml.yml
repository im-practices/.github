#
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    -  Any project that needs to report SAM information for Stewardship Mapping
#       See https://github.com/im-practices/master-architecture-plan/blob/main/Implementation%20Decisions/adr-015_system_architecture_metadata.md
#       for more information

#    - Create a sam.yaml file that describes the Bounded Context project information
