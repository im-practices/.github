# Workflow Code: AngryGoose_v15    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#   Automatically calculates the next semantic version and creates a tag on the repository
#   when a PR is merged. The tag is used in later workflows to deploy the tf or db.
#
# Note:
#    This workflow should not be used to tag repos that have CI workflows that create their own releases, like
#    the dotnet ci build because this workflow would conflict with that. This workflow is recommended for
#    things like infrastructure repositories or database projects that do not have a CI build which increments
#    their versions.
#
# Frequency:
#    This workflow should only be used once per repository
#    If the repo has multiple projects that need this workflow (like db and tf), multiple tags can be generated with
#    with this workflow by duplicating the increment version step and including different 'tag-prefix' args.
#
