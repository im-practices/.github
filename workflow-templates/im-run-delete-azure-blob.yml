# Workflow Code: ScornfulFlamingo_v8   DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    Deletes a blob from a specified Azure Storage Account when someone kicks it off manually.
#
# Frequency:
#    - This workflow should only be used once per repository
#
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    - Storage Account Deployments (Core Template)
#
# TODO: Prerequisites:
#    - Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
#    - The SP used in this workflow needs an additional permission (StorageBlob Data Contributor) so it can delete blobs
