# Workflow Code: distressedstoat_v1    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose: 
#    Pings a url and fails by default if the status code is 400+
#    
# Frequency:
#    - This workflow is intended to be used once per repository as is
#      but could be duplicated so the url-to-check can be hardcoded.
#    
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    -  On-Prem Service               (Optional Template)
#    -  Azure App Service or Function (Optional Template)
