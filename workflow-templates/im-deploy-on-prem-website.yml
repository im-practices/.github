# Workflow Code: FuzzyDragon_v20    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose: 
#    Gathers various stakeholder and attestor approvals, downloads artifacts from a release 
#    with the specified tags, makes changes to any configuration files for the specified environments, 
#    stops the app pool, deploys the pre-built artifacts to an on-prem machine then starts the app pool. 
#    Each deployable project in a solution should have their own deployment workflow.
#    
# Frequency:
#    Each deployable on-prem site in the repository should have their own copy of this workflow rather than trying to deploy several
#    on-prem websites with the same workflow.  If the site is deployed as part of a group, the site still needs its own copy of this
#    workflow but it will be streamlined (instructions below) since the Deploy Multiple Items workflow handles many of these checks.
#    
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    - On-Prem Site (Core Template)
#
# TODO: Prerequisites:
#    - Make sure the Service account secrets have been added to the environment
#    - Make sure the host IIS server has been prepped to accept incoming WinRM Requests
#      See the IIS App Pool action README for more details: https://github.com/im-open/iis-service-action/#readme
#    - Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
#    - Set up a deployment board if it does not already exist: https://github.com/im-practices/git-er-done/blob/main/actions/deployment-board.md
#      Generally one board should be set up per on-prem site in the repository.
