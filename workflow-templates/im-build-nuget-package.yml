# Workflow Code: TrustingCockroach_v36    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    Automatically builds the project and runs tests with code coverage. If
#    everything is green, a new semantic version is calculated and a new package
#    version and tag are pushed to the repository. When the PR is merged, the
#    package versions created for each branch commit in the PR are removed.
#
# Frequency: This workflow should be duplicated once per nuget package in the repository
#
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    - Nuget Package (Core Template)
#
# TODO Prerequisites:
#    - If the project contains a local nuget.config remove it.  It interferes with restoring packages on the GitHub Action runners.
#    - Make sure the .csproj file has been updated with the appropriate values required for GH Packages (PackageId, Version, RepositoryUrl)
#      https://github.com/im-practices/git-er-done/blob/main/packages/publish-nuget.md
#    - This workflow uses the elevated GH_PACKAGES_TOKEN secret to read/write/delete packages.  It is at the organization level but only
#      available to select repos.  To use this let a member of the SWAT team or Infra-Purple know and it can be enabled for your repository.

on:
  # This workflow will run for the PR events:
  #   opened/reopened: A PR is opened/re-opened,
  #   synchronize: The PR's head branch is updated (commits pushed, the base branch changed or the head is updated from the base branch)
  #   closed: A PR is merged or closed (The setup-build-workflow job makes sure we only run if a merge happened, not when a close happens)
  pull_request:
    # TODO: This will create a new nuget package for each push to the PR, determine if that is the desired behavior or if you only
    #        want a package created when a merge to main happens.

    # TODO: If there are multiple projects in the repo, add the path to the nuget package project so changes to those projects don't trigger this workflow
