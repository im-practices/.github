# Workflow Code: LoathsomeSnipe_v27    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    Automatically checks out the code, builds, run tests and creates artifacts
#    which are uploaded to a GH release when commits are pushed to a PR. In the
#    deployment workflows, the release artifacts uploaded in this workflow are
#    downloaded, configured for the environment and deployed.
#
# Frequency:
#    - This workflow should only be used once per repository
#
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    - Azure App Service or Function (Core Template)
#    - On-Prem Service               (Core Template)
#    - On-Prem Site                  (Core Template)
#
# TODO: Prerequisites:
#    - Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
#    - If the project contains a local nuget.config remove it.  It interferes with restoring packages on the GitHub Action runners.
