# Contributing
The following is a set of general guidelines for contributing to `im-practices` projects.
First consult the project's README.md to see if there are any contributing guidelines or links.  You can always reach out to the team listed in the `SAM.yaml` file fore more information as well.

## Code of Conduct
This project is governed by the `im-practices` Organization's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  By participating you are expected to uphold this code.    

We ask that all members speak up if they see behavior that does not align to this Code of Conduct, so managers can take appropriate action. If you are uncomfortable discussing something with your manager, please reach out to HR.

## Development Setup
All Enterprise members should have the ability to fork any Internal repository, commit changes on the fork and submit pull requests to the upstream repository from your fork.  If you aren't familiar with working with forks check out GitHub's [forks] documentation.  You can also work with the appropriate team to be added as a collaborator so you can push to the repository directly.

Most repository README.md files explain how to get the project up and running.  Please read through any instructions before contacting the team.  

## PR Guidelines
- Development should be done in dedicated branches.
- Make sure your tests pass.
- When adding new features, add accompanying test cases.
- Any changes should conform the team's conventions and standards for commits, code, tests, infrastructure and documentation.
